title: Draft Web Monetization Specification
sidebar_label: Specification
---

A [draft specification](https://webmonetization.org/specification.html) is being developed that is
suitable for the W3C standards track.

The specification reflects the desired end-state of the standard and APIs and is
**not** a good reference for current implementations (which are better described
  in the existing [API documentation](api.md)).
