Web Monetization lets you count exactly how much you made from a given visitor. The amount updates in real-time as more micropayments come in. Like any animated effect it should be used sparingly, but it can be a cool way to show your visitors exactly how much they're supporting you!

This example shows you how to use the `monetization` event to count how much you've made off of micropayments from a given visitor.

## Code

```html
<head>
  <!-- this should be set to your own payment pointer -->
  <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">

  <script>
    let total = 0
    let scale

    if (window.MonetizationEvent) {
      const link = document.querySelector('link[rel="monetization"]')
      link.addEventListener('monetization', ev => {
        // initialize currency and scale on first progress event
        if (total === 0) {
          scale = ev.assetScale
          document.getElementById('currency').innerText = ev.assetCode
        }

        total += Number(ev.amount)

        const formatted = (total * Math.pow(10, -scale)).toFixed(scale)
        document.getElementById('total').innerText = formatted
      })
    }
  </script>
</head>

<body>
  <p>
    Thanks to you, I've made
    <span id="total">nothing (yet)</span>
    <span id="currency"></span>
  </p>
</body>
```

## How does it work?

If the visitor is web monetized (`window.MonetizationEvent` is defined), we're
binding the `monetization` event. The `monetization` event contains
details about the micropayments that occur.

```js
if (window.MonetizationEvent) {
  const link = document.querySelector('link[rel="monetization"]')
  link.addEventListener('monetization', ev => {
```

There's some attributes of the micropayments that don't change, like currency details. We set these currency details on the very first micropayment.

```js
// initialize currency and scale on first progress event
if (total === 0) {
  scale = ev.assetScale
  document.getElementById('currency').innerText = ev.assetCode
}
```

`ev.assetCode` is a three-letter code that describes the currency of the micropayment, like `USD`, `EUR`, or `GBP`.

The asset code describes the asset the [Web Monetization
receiver](glossary.md#web-monetization-receiver) is
denominating their incoming payments in. This often matches the currency your wallet account uses, but not always.

The asset code will stay the same for a given payment pointer (your wallet provider should warn you if they change it). It is not affected by the currency that the Web Monetization provider uses.

`ev.assetScale` defines how small the units of amount will be on this payment pointer. A bigger scale means smaller units. If your scale is 2 and your asset code is USD, then it means you need 100 (`10 ** 2`) units to get one dollar.

The amount in `ev.amount` is an integer, which we add to our total.

```js
total += Number(ev.amount)
```

> Even though `ev.amount` is a string that can represent a number up to
> 64 bits long in theory (too big for a JavaScript number), it's OK for us to
> convert it to a JavaScript number here. The micropayment amounts in Web
> Monetization are far from pushing the limits. With USD and a scale of 9, for
> instance, it would take around 500,000 years to overflow this number.

Finally, we update the text on the page with our new total. Our total is an
integer with the total number of indivisible units. We want it to be a more
readable decimal number, though, so we apply the scale to format it. This
formatted version of the amount gets written to the `total` span on the page.

```js
const formatted = (total * Math.pow(10, -scale)).toFixed(scale)
document.getElementById('total').innerText = formatted
```

## Interactive example

This example simulates showing the amount being streamed from a web monetized visitor. The example doesn't require you to have Web Monetization enabled in your browser. No real payments are occurring.
