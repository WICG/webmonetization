The Web Monetization API provides a seamless payment experience for site owners and visitors. Unlike the W3C's [Payment Request API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API), the Web Monetization API sends continuous micro-payments from the user agent to the website. Thus, visitors automatically send a small sum per time unit to any Web Monetized website they visit. The payment rate is predetermined by the user's Web Monetization agent and adapts over time.

## Web Monetization Concepts and Usage

The Web Monetization API allows web apps to accept continuous micro-payments from users. There are two components to this API:

- The Web Monetization Agent is designed to be implemented in browsers and expose the Web Monetization API. It's responsible to:
  - get the rate, token, and payment connection address from the Web Monetization Provider
  - get the payment information from the `<link>` element
  - create an [incoming payment](https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/create-incoming-payment) via the [Open Payments API](https://docs.openpayments.guide)
  <Hidden>- create an [Interledger](https://interledger.org/) payment connection via either the [STREAM](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0029-stream/) protocol or the [Open Payments](https://docs.openpayments.guide/) standard</Hidden>
  - verify payment via the [outgoing payment](https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/create-outgoing-payment) endpoint on the web site owner's payment pointer via the [Open Payments API](https://docs.openpayments.guide)

- The Web Monetization Provider is intended to be the entity that facilitates payments to websites on behalf of the user. It's designed to be side-loaded via an extension, essentially allowing users to choose their provider by installing a different extension. It would only be responsible for offering the browser information about the rate, token, and provider address. Ideally, there would be a separate extension category for Web Monetization Providers.  A website visitor can also potentially be their own Web Monetization Provider through the use of a digital wallet that implements the [Open Payments API](https://openpayments.guide) standard.   

Currently, the Agent and Provider are loaded via the same extension until the Web Monetization Agent is implemented in browsers.
