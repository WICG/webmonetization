## Create your wallet

1. Log in to your [GateHub account](https://signin.gatehub.net).
2. Click the wallet drop-down arrow in the upper-left.
3. Click **+Add wallet**.
4. Select **Hosted** wallet.
5. Enter your password.
6. Enter a wallet name and click **Create**. Your wallet is now created.
7. Click **Add Funds**.
8. Select **Interledger Payment pointer**, then copy your payment pointer.
    > Refresh the page if you don't see the Interledger option. This is shown in the screen capture below.

Now you can share your payment pointer with other sites or add it to your own site by following the [Quick Start Guide](getting-started.md).
