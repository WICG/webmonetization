## View activity, claim funds, and make a withdrawal

### View activity

Uphold's Android and iOS apps show incoming payments in real time; however, the website **does not**. This means payments might not show up on the website right away. A payment becomes visible on the website when the payment is claimed.

You can watch payment streams in the app by tapping **Activity** from the toolbar. You can tap any activity that shows on the screen to see more details.

<img src={UpholdClaim01} height="500"/>

### Claim funds

Before your funds can be withdrawn, they must be claimed. App users can manually claim funds over one cent (USD). Website users **cannot** manually claim funds.

Uphold will automatically claim funds when the conditions listed below are met. A payment becomes visible on the website only **after** the payment is claimed.

* Accrued funds of $0.01 USD through $0.99 USD are auto-claimed every 24 hours
* Accrued funds of $1.00 USD or more are auto-claimed every hour

If you know you've received a payment, but it's not showing up on the website, it could be that:

* Your balance is less than $0.01 USD and can't be claimed
* Your balance is at least $0.01 USD, but not enough time has passed for Uphold to auto-claim the payment

As an app user, when you've received the minimum amount required to make a manual claim, the Claim Funds button becomes active. If you don't manually claim funds, Uphold will do it for you.

After the funds are claimed, the transaction's status changes to Completed.

<img src={UpholdClaim03} height="500"/>

The transaction shows as deposited on the Activity screen on both the app and the website.

### Make a withdrawal

The steps for making a withdrawal depend on whether you want the funds deposited into a bank account or to a crypto network. Review Uphold's documentation for details:

* [Withdraw directly to your bank account](https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043630451)
* [Withdraw directly to a crypto network](https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043630691)
