## View activity and claim funds

### App

The app shows incoming activity in real time. You can watch the payment streams by tapping **Activity** from the toolbar.

<img src="assets/uphold/upholdClaim01.png" height="500">

You can tap any activity that shows on the screen to see more details. When you've received the minimum amount required to claim the funds, the **Claim funds** button becomes active.

<img src="assets/uphold/upholdClaim02.png" height="500">

Uphold will claim funds on your behalf every hour as long as you've received a claimable amount. The amount varies based on currency. For example, you must have at least $0.01 before you can claim a USD payment. After funds are claimed, the transaction's status changes to Completed.

<img src="assets/uphold/upholdClaim03.png" height="500">

When claimed, the transaction shows as deposited on the Activity screen.

<img src="assets/uphold/upholdClaim04.png" height="500">

### Website

Unlike the app, the website **does not** allow you to view incoming payments in real time.

An hour after you've received at least the minimum claimable amount, Uphold will deposit the amount to your account. The amount varies based on currency. For example, Uphold will not deposit an amount in USD that's less than $0.01.

On the dashboard, click **Activity** to see all activity or click a specific card to see activity for that card.
