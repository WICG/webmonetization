## View activity and claim funds

The iOS and Android apps show incoming activity in real time; however, the website **does not**.

There's a delay of **at least one hour** before payments show up in the web interface. One hour after you've received at least the minimum claimable amount, Uphold deposits the amount into your account.

The minimum claimable amount varies based on currency. For example, Uphold will not deposit an amount in USD that's less than $0.01. If you receive less than $0.01, you won't see the amount in the web interface until your balance reaches $0.01, regardless of how much time has passed.

### App

The app shows incoming activity in real time. You can watch the payment streams by tapping **Activity** from the toolbar.

<img src="assets/uphold/upholdClaim01.png" height="500">

You can tap any activity that shows on the screen to see more details. When you've received the minimum amount required to claim the funds, the **Claim funds** button becomes active.

<img src="assets/uphold/upholdClaim02.png" height="500">

Uphold will claim funds on your behalf every hour as long as you've received a claimable amount. The amount varies based on currency. For example, you must have at least $0.01 before you can claim a USD payment. After funds are claimed, the transaction's status changes to Completed.

<img src="assets/uphold/upholdClaim03.png" height="500">

When claimed, the transaction shows as deposited on the Activity screen.

### Website

Unlike the iOS and Android apps, the website **does not** allow you to view incoming payments in real time. There's a delay of **at least one hour** before payments show up in the web interface.

One hour after you've received at least the minimum claimable amount, Uphold will deposit the amount to your account. The amount varies based on currency. For example, Uphold will not deposit an amount in USD that's less than $0.01.

On the dashboard, click **Activity** to see all activity or click a specific card to see activity for that card.

## Create additional payment pointers

You can create additional payment pointers by adding more cards to your Uphold account. Each card supports one payment pointer.

You can create additional cards through the Uphold website and the app. The **website** is a bit easier to navigate. See the [Set up your account - Website](#website) section above and begin at step 2.

To add a new card in the **app**:

1. Tap **Transact**.

2. Tap the **To** menu. There will be a gray arrow next to any currencies already assigned to a card.
