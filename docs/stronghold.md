**Stronghold is discontinuing Web Monetization support effective August 20, 2020.** Web Monetization providers will be unable to stream payments to Stronghold wallets after August 20.

If you are using Stronghold as your digital wallet provider, we recommend taking the following steps before August 20.

1. Withdraw your balance from your [Stronghold account](https://identity.stronghold.co/login). Stronghold cannot transfer your balance to a different wallet provider. If you need help making a withdrawal, check out Stronghold's help documentation.
2. Sign up for an [Uphold](https://uphold.com/en-us/) or [GateHub](https://gatehub.net/) account and get a new payment pointer.
3. Update your Web Monetization meta tag to reference your new payment pointer.
