Nested browsing contexts (iframes) can contain monetization `<link>` elements; however, your site visitor’s Web Monetization agent determines how iframes are monetized. A few examples of how a Web Monetization agent can monetize iframes include:

* Splitting payments evenly between all monetization links within both the parent and the iframe
* Splitting payments evenly between all monetization links in the parent and the first monetization link it finds in the iframe’s `<head>`, while ignoring any other monetization links in the iframe
    :::note
    This is the approach used in the <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/web-monetization-extension">Interledger Foundation’s extension</LinkOut>.
