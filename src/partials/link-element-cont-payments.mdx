If your visitor is sending continuous payments, the payments will continue for as long as your web monetized page is active and in view. Continuous payments stop if your visitor:

- Disables the extension
- Disables continuous payments within the extension’s settings
- Minimizes their browser
- Changes focus away from your site/switches to a different tab
- Closes your site or their browser
- Spends all of their budget
