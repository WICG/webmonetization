An HTML page can contain multiple monetization `<link>` elements; however, your site visitor’s [Web Monetization agent](#web-monetization-agent) could be designed to handle multiple links in a particular way. For example, an agent might:

* Split payments evenly between all links
* Split payments between the first few links it finds
* Send the amount only to the first link it finds and ignore all others

:::tip[Recommendation]
The Web Monetization agent built into the <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/web-monetization-extension">Interledger Foundation’s extension</LinkOut> splits payments evenly between all links. We recommend other extension developers follow this approach.
