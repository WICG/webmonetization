An HTML page can contain multiple monetization `<link>` elements, but your site visitor’s Web Monetization agent could be designed to handle multiple links in a particular way. For example, an agent could:

- Split payments evenly between all links
- Split payments between the first few links it finds
- Send the amount only to the first link it finds and ignore all others

The Web Monetization agent built into the <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/web-monetization-extension">Interledger Foundation’s extension</LinkOut> splits payments evenly between all links, even if the same wallet address is used in multiple links.
