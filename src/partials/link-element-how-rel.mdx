Browsers already know how to interpret certain `rel` values because of web standards. One such standard is `stylesheet`. When a browser loads a page that contains `<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">`, the browser automatically knows to import a style sheet from the given URL.

The `monetization` link type, however, is not yet a standard. Major web browsers don't automatically know what to do when encountering this link type in a page. Until `monetization` becomes a standard, browsers must rely on a Web Monetization agent.
