Browsers already know how to interpret certain `rel` values because of web standards. One such standard is `stylesheet`. When a browser loads a page that contains `<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">`, the browser automatically knows to import a style sheet from the given URL.

The `monetization` link type, however, isn't a standard yet. Major web browsers don't automatically know what to do when encountering this link type in a page. Until `monetization` becomes a standard, browsers must rely on a Web Monetization agent, like the one built into Interledger Foundation's [Web Monetization extension](/supporters/get-started).
