Web Monetization is an immediate and secure way for you to support websites, content owners, and publishers.

With Web Monetization, you can express your gratitude by making a one-time contribution or by sending continuous payments as you spend time on their content. Visit the [Get started](/supporters/get-started) page for instructions.

## Benefits

- <EmphasisText text='Control who, when, and how much to pay.' />
  All payments to web monetized sites must be explicitly authorized or
  pre-authorized by you. Sites can't pull payments from your payment account
  under any circumstance.

- <EmphasisText text='Your payments are private.' />
  Web Monetization doesn't provide the recipient with personally identifiable
  information such as your name, wallet address, IP address, or anything else
  the recipient could use to correlate a payment with you.

- <EmphasisText text='You choose your wallet provider.' />
  Some solutions require you to sign up for a particular application, platform,
  or service provider to support your favorite content. As long as your chosen
  wallet provider is compatible with Web Monetization, you can send payments to
  any web monetized sites.

- <EmphasisText text='Your payment details are stored with your wallet.' />
  Part of setting up the Web Monetization extension involves linking the
  extension to your wallet. This link allows the extension to communicate with
  your wallet without storing sensitive payment details in the extension or in
  the browser itself.

- <EmphasisText text="Web Monetization isn't tied to a specific currency." />
  Part of choosing a compatible digital wallet is selecting one that allows you
  to pay in your preferred currency. When you send a payment, the recipient will
  receive it in the currency they selected when signing up with their compatible
  wallet provider.

- <EmphasisText text="There's no separate Web Monetization account(s)." />
  The only account you need is the one you create with your wallet provider. You
  don't have to create separate accounts for each website you want to pay.

## Constraints

- <EmphasisText text="Web Monetization isn't an ad blocker." />
  Sending a payment to a web monetized site doesn't guarantee an ad-free
  experience. Web Monetization provides publishers an alternative revenue model
  to ads, but the decision whether to load ads in response to a payment is
  entirely theirs.

- <EmphasisText text='The network of Web Monetization-enabled wallet providers is nascent, but growing.' />
  Sending and receiving payments via Web Monetization requires the sender and
  the recipient to have an account with a Web Monetization-enabled wallet
  provider.
  <p>
    In general, wallet providers are regulated entities within the countries
    they operate. Obtaining the proper licensing and registration to become a
    wallet provider can be an expensive, complex, and time consuming process.
    There are also technical integrations required to support Web Monetization.
    This all means a compatible wallet provider may not yet be available in your
    area.
