Web Monetization is an immediate and secure way for you to support websites, content owners, and publishers. 

With Web Monetization, you can express your gratitude by making a one-time contribution or by sending continuous payments as you spend time on their content. Visit the [Get started](/supporters/get-started) page for instructions.

## Benefits

- <EmphasisText text="Control who, when, and how much to pay." />All payments to web monetized sites must be explicitly authorized or pre-authorized by you. Sites can't pull payments from your payment account under any circumstance.

- <EmphasisText text="Your payments are private." />Web Monetization doesn't provide the recipient with personally identifiable information such as your name, wallet address, IP address, or anything else the recipient could use to correlate a payment with you.

- <EmphasisText text="You choose your wallet provider." />Some solutions require you to sign up for a particular application, platform, or service provider to support your favorite content. As long as your chosen wallet provider is compatible with Web Monetization, you can send payments to any web monetized sites.

- <EmphasisText text="Your payment details are stored with your wallet." />Part of setting up the Web Monetization extension involves linking the extension to your wallet. This link allows the extension to communicate with your wallet without storing sensitive payment details in the extension or in the browser itself.

- <EmphasisText text="Web Monetization isn't tied to a specific currency." />Part of choosing a compatible digital wallet is selecting one that allows you to pay in your preferred currency. When you send a payment, the recipient will receive it in the currency they selected when signing up with their compatible wallet provider.

- <EmphasisText text="There's no separate Web Monetization account(s)." />The only account you need is the one you create with your wallet provider. You don't have to create separate accounts for each website you want to pay.

## Constraints

- <EmphasisText text="Web Monetization isn't an ad blocker." />Sending a payment to a web monetized site doesn't guarantee an ad-free experience. Web Monetization provides publishers an alternative revenue model to ads, but the decision whether to load ads in response to a payment is entirely theirs.

- <EmphasisText text="The network of Web Monetization-enabled wallet providers is nascent, but growing." />Sending and receiving payments via Web Monetization requires the sender and the recipient to have an account with a Web Monetization-enabled wallet provider.<p>In general, wallet providers are regulated entities within the countries they operate. Obtaining the proper licensing and registration to become a wallet provider can be an expensive, complex, and time consuming process. There are also technical integrations required to support Web Monetization. This all means a compatible wallet provider may not yet be available in your area.</p>
