## Interledger test wallet

The Interledger test wallet provides a great way to test Web Monetization without using real money. The test wallet is an open-source application developed and maintained by the [Interledger Foundation](https://interledger.org). 

The [Test Web Monetization](/experiment/guides/test-web-monetization) page gives step-by-step directions for creating an account on the Interledger test network and setting up your test wallet.
