Add a <LinkOut href="https://webmonetization.org/tools/widget">payment widget</LinkOut> to your site so visitors can send you a one-time payment. The widget appears to all visitors, even those with an active Web Monetization extension.

### Before you begin

- Your visitor must have a wallet address with a [compatible wallet](/wallets) to send a payment using the widget.
- If your site is monetized with multiple wallet addresses, only the address connected to the widget will receive one-time payments. You can [change the address](#connect-widget-to-a-new-wallet-address) connected to the widget at any time.

## Create a new widget

### Connect your wallet

<Connect />

### Change the widget's contents (optional)

1. Change the label of a configuration by selecting the pencil icon and typing over the default.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/tools-preset-labels.png" alt="Screen with three tabs, all with default labels, and a pencil icon appearing next to the first label" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />
2. Expand the _Content_ drop-down menu. Enter a title for the widget or choose from the suggested options.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/widget-title.png" alt="Panel showing suggested titles and a field to enter a custom title" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />
3. Enter the message to show to your visitors or use the default text. We suggest changing the message so that it's tailored specifically to your audience.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/widget-message.png" alt="Panel with a checkbox to mark the message as visible and a blank field to enter a custom message" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />
4. Review your changes in the preview panel.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/widget-content-preview.png" alt="Preview panel showing how the widget will appear with a custom title and message" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />
5. Click **Done** to collapse the Content section.

### Change the widget's appearance

1. Select the font and font size to use in the widget.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/widget-font.png" alt="Panel showing the font family drop-down menu and a size slider" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />
2. Select the background, text, and button colors to use.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/widget-colors.png" alt="Panel showing background, text, and button color previews. Selecting a preview opens a menu with a paint can icon and a set of preselected colors to choose from" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />Click the paint can icon to enter a hex value or use the color picker.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/widget-color-picker.png" alt="The color picker tool with a field for the hex value at the bottom" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />
   :::note
   Changing the color of the button also changes the title bar's background color.
   :::
3. Select the widget's corner radius and position.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/widget-corner-position.png" alt="Panel showing container corner radius options of no, light, and pill rounding and position options of left and right" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />

### Generate your script

1. Click **Save and generate script**.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/tools-save-buttons.png" alt="The save edits only and the save and generate script buttons side by side" style="max-width: 45%" class='img-outline' />
   :::note[Save edits only]
   Click **Save edits only** if you aren't ready to generate your script. Your configurations are saved on webmonetization.org.
   :::
2. Add the script to your site. We recommend placing it just before the closing `</body>` tag. If you're using a site management tool like WordPress, you'll place the code in a script-type element.
   ```js wrap title="Example script"
   <script
     id="wmt-widget-init-script"
     type="module"
     src="https://tools-cdn.webmonetization.org/widget.js"
     data-wallet-address="https://sandbox.ilp.link/rabeb"
     data-tag="version1"
   ></script>
   ```
3. Go to your site and check that the widget appears correctly.

You're now ready to accept one-time payments. Remember that if your site is monetized with multiple wallet addresses that only the address connected to the widget receives one-time payments.

## Change an existing widget configuration

1. Enter your wallet address.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/tools-connect-wallet.png" alt="Blank wallet address field and continue button" style="max-width: 50%" class='img-outline' />
2. Click **Continue**. If the confirmation prompt appears, you must first confirm your ownership of the wallet address.
3. Make your changes, then click **Save edits only**. Your [script](#generate-your-script) remains the same. There's no need to update your site's code.
4. Refresh a page on your site that uses the configuration's script to verify your changes are live.

## Connect widget to a new wallet address

<Change />

All payments through the widget will now be directed to the new wallet address.
