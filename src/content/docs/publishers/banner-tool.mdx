Create a <LinkOut href="https://webmonetization.org/tools/banner">banner</LinkOut> that appears when your visitors don't have the Web Monetization extension or have the extension turned off. The banner includes a link to download the extension from your visitor's browser store.

All pages that include the banner script are automatically web monetized with your wallet address. This means you can exclude the [monetization link tag](/developers/link-element) from your site's code unless you want your pages monetized with additional wallet addresses.

## Create a new banner

### Connect your wallet

<Connect />

### Change the banner's contents (optional)

Change the label of a configuration by selecting the pencil icon and typing over the default.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/tools-preset-labels.png" alt="Screen with three tabs, all with default labels, and a pencil icon appearing next to the first label" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />

3. Enter the message to show to your visitors or use the default text. We suggest changing the message so that it's tailored specifically to your audience.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/banner-message.png" alt="Panel with a checkbox to mark the message as visible and a blank field to enter a custom message" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />

Selecting a preview opens a menu with a paint can icon and a set of preselected colors to choose from" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />Click the paint can icon to enter a hex value or use the color picker.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/banner-color-picker.png" alt="The color picker tool with a field for the hex value at the bottom" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />
3. Select the banner's corner radius and position.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/banner-corner-position.png" alt="Panel showing container corner radius options of no, light, and pill rounding and position options of bottom and top" style="max-width: 60%" class='img-outline' />

### Generate your script

1. Click **Save and generate script**.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/tools-save-buttons.png" alt="The save edits only and the save and generate script buttons side by side" style="max-width: 45%" class='img-outline' />
2. Add the script to your site.
   ```js wrap title="Example script"
   <script
     id="wmt-banner-init-script"
     type="module"
     src="https://tools-cdn.webmonetization.org/banner.js"
     data-wallet-address="https://sandbox.ilp.link/rabeb"
     data-tag="version1"
   ></script>
   ```
3. Go to your site and check that the banner appears correctly. If you have the Web Monetization extension installed, you might need to disable the extension for the banner to appear.

## Change an existing banner configuration

1. Enter your wallet address.<br /><img src="/img/docs/pubtools/tools-connect-wallet.png" alt="Blank wallet address field and continue button" style="max-width: 50%" class='img-outline' />
2. Click **Continue**. If the confirmation prompt appears, you must first confirm your ownership of the wallet address.
3. Make your changes, then click **Save edits only**. Your [script](#generate-your-script) remains the same. There's no need to update your site's code.
4. Refresh a page on your site that uses the configuration's script to verify your changes are live.

## Connect banner to a new wallet address

<Change />

All pages that include the script are now web monetized with the new wallet address.
