The `<link>` element enables you to [add Web Monetization to an HTML document](/docs/guides/monetize-page). The `rel` value must be `monetization`. The `href` value must be a URL representing an Open Payments-enabled wallet address, such as a payment pointer.

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example/alice" />
```

A single HTML document can contain multiple monetization `<link>` elements; however, it's up to each Web Monetization provider to decide how they want to handle this scenario. We recommend Web Monetization providers split the payments evenly between the links.

## Payment pointers and meta elements

The first version of the Web Monetization spec supported both the `<meta>` and `<link>` elements. The `<meta>` element supported payment pointers written in shorthand form (e.g., `$wallet.example/alice`).

Now, Web Monetization only supports the `<link>` element. The `<link>` element does not support shorthand and requires payment pointers be in URL format (e.g., `https://wallet.example/alice`). In most cases, you can simply replace the `$` with `https://`. However, we suggest entering your payment pointer into the input field on <LinkOut href="https://paymentpointers.org">paymentpointers.org</LinkOut> to convert it from shorthand to URL.

:::note
The Web Monetization specification references payment pointers, but any Open Payments-enabled wallet address in URL form can be used as the 'href' value.
