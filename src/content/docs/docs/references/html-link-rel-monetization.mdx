The `<link>` element enables you to [add Web Monetization to an HTML document](/docs/guides/monetize-page). The `rel` value must be `monetization`. The `href` value must be a URL representing a payment pointer.

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example/alice" />
```

A single HTML document can contain multiple monetization `<link>` elements; however, it's up to each WM provider to decide how they want to handle this scenario. We recommend WM providers split the payments evenly between the links.

## Payment pointers

The first version of the Web Monetization spec favored `<meta>` over `<link>`. The `<meta>` element supported payment pointers written in shorthand form (e.g., `$wallet.example/alice`).

The `<link>` element doesn't support shorthand and requires the `href` value be the URL that the payment pointer resolves to (e.g., `https://wallet.example/alice`).

If you need help converting a payment pointer from shorthand to its equivalent URL, enter your payment pointer into the input field on <LinkOut href="https://paymentpointers.org">paymentpointers.org</LinkOut>. In most cases, you can simply replace the `$` with `https://`.
