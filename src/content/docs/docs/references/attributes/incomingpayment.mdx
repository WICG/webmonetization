:::tip[Experimental Attribute]
`incomingPayment` is an <LinkOut href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#experimental">experimental technology</LinkOut>.
:::

The `monetization` event's `incomingPayment` attribute can be used to verify the receipt of a payment. Today, the `monetization` event fires when the Web Monetization agent successfully creates an outgoing payment request at the Web Monetization provider. Since it's only a request to send an outgoing payment, there's no guarantee at this point that a payment has been received.

The `incomingPayment` attribute returns the URL that represents the incoming payment at the Web Monetization receiver. The returned value is the value it was initialized with. By <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.guide/apis/resource-server/operations/get-incoming-payment/">querying the URL</LinkOut>, you can get the `receivedAmount`.

## Example

```jsx
/** @type {MonetizationEvent} event */
async function verifyPayment(event) {
  // Legacy receivers don't support returning incoming payment URLs
  if (!event.incomingPayment) {
    throw new Error('No incoming payment URL')
  }

  const response = await fetch(event.incomingPayment, {
    method: 'GET',
    credentials: 'same-origin',
    mode: 'same-origin',
    cache: 'no-cache',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  })

  if (response.ok) {
    // The incoming payment was fetched successfully
    const { receivedAmount } = await response.json()
    const { amount, assetCode, assetScale } = receivedAmount
    console.log(`Received ${assetCode}${amount / Math.pow(10, assetScale)}.`)
  }
}
```
