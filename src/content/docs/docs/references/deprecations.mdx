### `<meta>` element removed

Earlier versions of the Web Monetization specification supported both the `<meta>` and `<link>` elements. Now, only the `<link>` element is supported.

### Interledger Protocol payment pointers replaced with Open Payments wallet addresses

Web Monetization now uses the [Open Payments API specification](https://openpayments.dev/) instead of the [STREAM Interledger Transport protocol](https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/stream-protocol/). A monetization link now must be the URL of an Open Payments wallet address. Open Payments wallet addresses do not support payment pointer shorthand (e.g. `$wallet.example/alice`) and must be fully expressed URLs (e.g. `https://wallet.example/alice`).

If your Web Monetization provider has not provided you a wallet address, try converting your payment pointer from a shorthand form to URL on <LinkOut href="https://paymentpointers.org">paymentpointers.org</LinkOut>.

### `MonetizationEvent` attributes `amount`, `assetCode`, `assetScale`, `receipt` removed

Web Monetization now uses the [Open Payments API specification](https://openpayments.dev/) instead of the [STREAM Interledger Transport protocol](https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/stream-protocol/).

`MonetizationEvent` now represents the amount sent instead of the amount received. The new `incomingPayment` attribute may be used to determine the amount received. Therefore, `amount`, `assetCode`, `assetScale` are no longer attributes on the event. Consider using [`amountSent`](/docs/references/attributes/amountsent) instead.

STREAM receipts are no longer relevant to the `MonetizationEvent` and have been removed.
