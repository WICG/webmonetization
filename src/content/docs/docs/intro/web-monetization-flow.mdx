Web Monetization (WM) relies on <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.guide">Open Payments</LinkOut> (OP) and OP-enabled accounts to coordinate payments.

The <Tooltip content='Code in a web browser, such as an extension, that discovers web monetized pages, exposes the Web Monetization API, and communicates with the Open Payments APIs' client:load><a href="./resources/glossary#web-monetization-agent">WM agent</a></Tooltip> first issues a series of API calls to the receiving account's <Tooltip content='A URL that identifies an Open Payments account' client:load><a href="./resources/glossary#payment-pointer">payment pointer</a></Tooltip>, then to the sending account's payment pointer, to obtain the necessary authorization and instructions for sending a payment. This page describes the Web Monetization flow by providing an example set of these API calls.

## Reminders

There's a few points to keep in mind as you review the example.

- It's up to the site visitor, not the web monetized site, to decide how often and how much to pay, as well as the currency in which to send a payment.

- While Web Monetization and Open Payments work together to coordinate payments, neither moves money. Payment processing and settlement must occur between the sending and receiving accounts over a common payment rail.

## Web Monetization flow

Alice has web monetized her site by adding the monetization `<link>` element to each page. Included within each `<link>` is her payment pointer (`https://wallet.example/alice`), assigned to her by her <Tooltip content='An entity that provides an Open Payments-enabled account into which payments can be received' client:load><a href="./resources/glossary#web-monetization-receiver">WM receiver</a></Tooltip>.

Bob has signed up with a <Tooltip content='An entity that provides a funded Open Payments-enabled account from which payments can be sent' client:load><a href="./resources/glossary#web-monetization-provider">WM provider</a></Tooltip> who's supplied him with a funded sending account. The sending account's payment pointer is `https://anotherwallet.example/bob`. After installing a WM agent into his browser and linking the WM agent to his WM provider, his WM agent now has permission to request payments be sent from his account.

:::note
This example assumes the WM provider and WM receiver have already peered with each other and share a common payment rail over which transactions can be processed and settled.

### Check for Web Monetization

As Bob browses Alice's site, his WM agent detects a monetization `<link>` element.

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example/alice" />
```

### Send request to site's payment pointer

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Request">
        The WM agent issues a request to Alice's payment pointer to discover the Open Payments service endpoint.

        <CodeBlock title="Request">
        ```http
        GET /alice HTTP/1.1
        Accept: application/json
        Host: wallet.example
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Response">
        The response includes, among other details, the URL for her WM receiver's grant request endpoint (authorization server).

        <CodeBlock title="Response">
        ```http
        HTTP/1.1 200 Success
        Content-Type: application/json

        {
          "id":"https://wallet.example/alice",
          "assetCode":"USD",
          "assetScale":2,
          "authServer":"https://wallet.example/auth"
        }
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Send grant request to WM receiver's auth server

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Request">
        The WM agent issues a request to the WM receiver's grant request endpoint (authorization server) to get an access token.

        In this example, the WM agent requests access to create and read incoming payments (i.e., payments coming in to Alice's WM receiver).

        <CodeBlock title="Request">
        ```http
        POST /auth/ HTTP/1.1
        Accept: application/json
        Content-Type: application/json
        Host: wallet.example
        Content-Length: 218

        {
          "access_token":{
            "access":[
              {
                "type":"incoming-payment",
                "actions":[
                  "create",
                  "read"
                ],
                "identifier":"https://wallet.example/alice"
              }
            ]
          },
          "interact":{
            "finish":{
            "method":"redirect"
            }
          },
          "client":"https://anotherwallet.example/bob"
        }
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Response">
        The grant request is non-interactive, so the WM receiver grants the request and issues an access token.

        <CodeBlock title="Response">
        ```http
        {
          "access_token":{
            "value":"OS9M2PMHKUR64TB8N6BW7OZB8CDFONP219RP1LT0",
            "manage":"https://wallet.example/auth/token/dd17a202-9982-4ed9-ae31-564947fb6379",
            "access":[
              {
                "type":"incoming-payment",
                "actions":[
                  "create",
                  "read"
                ],
                "identifier":"https://wallet.example/alice"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Send incoming payment request to WM receiver

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Request">
        The WM agent creates an incoming payment for the session (e.g., the open browser tab) by issuing an incoming payment request to the WM receiver. The request uses details obtained from the previous API calls.

:::note
The request is for an _incoming_ payment because the WM agent is requesting the WM receiver allow an incoming payment to Alice's account. The payment itself has not been sent yet.
:::

        <CodeBlock title="Request">
        ```http
        POST /alice/incoming-payments HTTP/1.1
        Accept: application/json
        Content-Type: application/json
        Authorization: OS9M2PMHKUR64TB8N6BW7OZB8CDFONP219RP1LT0
        Host: wallet.example
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Response">
        The WM receiver approves the request by supplying unique payment details for the WM agent to use to address the payment to Alice's account.

        <CodeBlock title="Response">
        ```http
        {
          "id":"https://wallet.example/alice/incoming-payments/  08394f02-7b7b-45e2-b645-51d04e7c330c",
          "paymentPointer":"https://wallet.example/alice",
          "receivedAmount":{
            "value":"0",

            "assetScale":2
          },
          "completed":false,

          "updatedAt":"2022-03-12T23:20:50.52Z"
        }
        ```
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Send quote request to WM provider

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Request">
        Up to this point, the WM agent has communicated with Alice's WM receiver. Now, the WM agent begins communicating with Bob's WM provider. 
        
        The WM agent sends the WM provider a quote that represents how much to send from Bob's account. In this example, the WM agent creates a quote for $0.02 USD.

        Since we're assuming the WM agent already has a grant to create an outgoing payment on Bob's account, the grant access token will appear as the `Authorization` value in the header.

        <CodeBlock title="Request">
        ```http
        POST /bob/quote HTTP/1.1
        Accept: application/json
        Content-Type: application/json
        Authorization: {{ quoteGrant.accessToken.value }}
        Host: anotherwallet.example

        {
          "receiver":"https://wallet.example/alice/incoming-payments/  08394f02-7b7b-45e2-b645-51d04e7c330c",
          "sendAmount":{
            "value":"2",
            "assetCode":"USD",
            "assetScale":2
          }
        }
        ```
        </CodeBlock>

    <TabItem label="Response">
        <CodeBlock title="Response">

        ```http
        {

            "assetCode":"USD",
            "assetScale":2
          },
          "receiveAmount":{
            "value":"2",
            "assetCode":"USD",
            "assetScale":2

### Send outgoing payment request to WM provider

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Request">
        The WM agent uses the details obtained thus far to create an outgoing payment request against Bob's payment pointer. Note that this is just a request to send a payment. The payment itself has not been sent yet.

        <CodeBlock title="Request">
        ```http
        POST /bob/outgoing-payment HTTP/1.1

The Web Monetization flow is complete. It's now up to the WM provider to process the payment and settle with the WM receiver.
