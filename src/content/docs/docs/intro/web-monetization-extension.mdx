The Interledger Foundation's Web Monetization [browser extension](#1-download-and-install-the-extension) allows you to support your favorite web monetized sites directly from your web browser in a quick, non-intrusive, and privacy-preserving way.

<StylishHeader>Web monetized sites</StylishHeader>

To use the extension to make Web Monetization payments, the site you visit must be web monetized. Since Web Monetization is fairly new, we encourage content owners and publishers tell their audience they're web monetized via a banner or some other method.

If you're interested in web monetizing your own content, the [Add Web Monetization to a page](/docs/guides/monetize-page) guide is a good place to start.

<StylishHeader>Web Monetization payments</StylishHeader>

To make Web Monetization payments, you only need a digital wallet from a Web Monetization-compatible [wallet provider](/docs/resources/op-wallets). There's no site-by-site account or subscription required for each individual site you want to support.

A web monetized site cannot initiate payments from your digital wallet. When you link the browser extension to your digital wallet, you're giving the extension permission to send payments on your behalf. These payments are automatically and continuously sent to each web monetized site you visit. You can also globally [disable continuous payments](#change-your-continuous-payment-settings).

The sites you pay are not provided with any of your personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, or IP address. 

:::note
Sending a payment to a web monetized site does not guarantee an ad-free experience. The decision to show or hide ads in response to a Web Monetization payment is entirely up to each content owner or publisher.

## Set up the extension

### 1. Download and install the extension

The extension is currently supported in the following browsers. We plan to support more browsers in the future. 

* <LinkOut href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-monetization-extensio/oiabcfomehhigdepbbclppomkhlknpii">Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers</LinkOut>
* <LinkOut href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-monetization-extension/">Mozilla Firefox</LinkOut>
* <LinkOut href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/web-monetization-extensio/imjgemgmeoioefpmfefmffbboogighjl">Microsoft Edge</LinkOut>

:::note[Permissions]
The extension will ask for permission to access your browser tabs and your data for all websites. The extension requires these permissions to check each page you visit for the Web Monetization [`<link>`](/docs/references/html-link-rel-monetization) element.
:::

### 2. Sign up with a compatible digital wallet

Sign up with a Web Monetization-compatible [wallet provider](/docs/resources/op-wallets).

After you've created your digital wallet, you'll be provided with a type of URL called a *wallet address*. You need this address in the next step. 

```html title="Example wallet address"
https://wallet.example.com/alice
```

### 3. Configure the extension

<Steps>
1. Open the extension and enter your wallet address in the given field.
    <img src="/img/docs/extension/connection-setup.png" alt="Extension setup screen with wallet address and amount fields, renew monthly toggle, and connect button" style="max-width:300px" class="img-outline"/>
2. Enter the amount to make available to spend. 
3. Optionally select the **Renew monthly** toggle. If you choose to not renew monthly, you'll need to manually [add more funds](#adjust-your-budget) when your remaining balance is zero.
4. Click **Connect**.
5. Click **Agree** to allow the extension to connect to your wallet and add a key to your account.<br /><img src="/img/docs/extension/connection-wallet.png" alt="Consent screen to allow the extension to connect to your wallet provider with agree and decline buttons" style="max-width:300px" class="img-outline"/><br />If your wallet provider's website opens in your browser, proceed to the next step. If you receive a connection error, review the instructions for [resolving the error](#resolve-a-key-addition-failure).
6. Sign in to your wallet account if you haven't already, then confirm the connection and budget amount. Below is an example confirmation screen.<br /><img src="/img/docs/extension/example-grant.png" alt="Example budget confirmation screen with accept and decline buttons" style="max-width:400px" class="img-outline" />A success screen appears when the connection is successful.<br /><img src="/img/docs/extension/connection-success.png" alt="Web page displaying a connection successful screen" style="max-width:400px" class="img-outline"/>
</Steps> 

## Change your continuous payment settings

A continuous payment is a payment that recurs at your set rate for as long as you are active on a web monetized page. When you leave the page, the payments stop.

Continuous payments are enabled by default and sent at a rate of $0.60 USD per hour. Use the instructions below to change the rate or disable continuous payments. 

<Steps>
1. Click the **Settings** icon in the upper-right of the extension.
    <br /><img src="/img/docs/extension/settings-icon.png" alt="Extension showing a cog icon in the upper-right" style="max-width:300px" class="img-outline"/>
2. Select the *Rate* tab.
    <br /><img
    src="/img/docs/extension/rate-tab.png"
    alt="Rate tab with rate of pay per hour field and continuous payment toggle"
    style="max-width:300px"
    class="img-outline"
    />
3. Enter the amount the extension will send, per hour, to web monetized sites.
4. Select the **Continuous payment** toggle to enable/disable continuous payments. This is a global setting that applies to all web monetized pages you visit.
</Steps>

## Make a one-time payment 

You can make a one-time payment to a page instead of -- or in addition to -- continuous payments. The amount of the one-time payment is deducted from your budget. 

<Steps>
1. Ensure the URL shown above the amount field is the page you intend to pay. 
    <br /><img
    src="/img/docs/extension/otp-send-now.png"
    alt="Extension showing an available balance of five dollars, with one dollar in the amount field and send now button active"
    style="max-width:300px"
    class="img-outline"
    />
2. Enter an amount. Be sure your balance can cover the amount, otherwise the payment will fail. Click **Send now**.
    <br /><img
    src="/img/docs/extension/otp-success.png"
    alt="Extension showing an available balance of four dollars, with a success message indicating one dollar was sent"
    style="max-width:300px"
    class="img-outline"
    />
</Steps>

## Adjust your budget 

<Steps>
1. Click the **Settings** icon in the upper-right of the extension.
    <br /><img src="/img/docs/extension/settings-icon.png" alt="Extension showing a cog icon in the upper-right" style="max-width:300px" class="img-outline"/>
2. Select the *Budget* tab.
    <br /><img src="/img/docs/extension/budget-tab-full-budget.png" alt="Budget tab showing your remaining balance and options to change budget amount and renewal" style="max-width:300px" class="img-outline"/>
3. Enter the new amount in the **Budget amount** field.
4. Select the **Monthly** toggle to enable/disable monthly renewals of your budget.
5. Click **Submit changes**. A new tab opens to your wallet provider. 
6. Sign in to your wallet account if you haven't already, then confirm the new budget.
</Steps>

## Disconnect the extension from your wallet

When you disconnect the extension from your wallet, the extension can no longer make payments. You can always reconnect your wallet later.

:::tip[Remaining balance]
You won't lose your remaining balance if you disconnect the extension from your wallet. Your remaining balance will remain in your wallet account. 
:::

The extension only supports one wallet connection at a time. If, for example, you have two wallet accounts from which you want to make payments, you must disconnect from the first wallet before you can connect the extension to your second wallet. 

<Steps>
1. Click the **Settings** icon in the upper-right of the extension.
    <br /><img src="/img/docs/extension/settings-icon.png" alt="Extension showing a cog icon in the upper-right" style="max-width:300px" class="img-outline"/>
2. Click **Disconnect**.
    <br /><img
    src="/img/docs/extension/wallet-tab.png"
    alt="Extension's wallet tab showing the disconnect button"
    style="max-width:300px"
    class="img-outline"
    />
    The extension's setup screen appears with your previously used wallet address and budget settings prefilled.
    <img
    src="/img/docs/extension/connection-setup-filled.png"
    alt="Extension's setup screen with previously used wallet address, budget amount, and recurrence setting saved"
    style="max-width:300px"
    class="img-outline"
    />
</Steps>

## Resolve a key addition failure <a id="manually-add-key"></a>

When you try to connect the extension to your digital wallet, the extension attempts to automatically connect with your wallet provider to add a key to your wallet account. 

You'll receive an error if the extension is unable to add the key. 

<img
    src="/img/docs/extension/connection-failed.png"
    alt="Extension showing an automatic connection error, the key you must copy, and a copy button for the key"
    style="max-width:300px"
    class="img-outline"
    />

When this happens, you must copy the key that appears in the extension and manually add it to your wallet account. The steps for adding the key to your account will vary between wallet providers.

<StylishHeader>Interledger Wallet</StylishHeader>

Follow these steps if your wallet provider is [Interledger wallet](https://interledger.app). 

<Steps>
1. Sign in to your Interledger Wallet.
2. Select **Settings** from the left menu.
3. Select **Keys**.
4. Click **Add a public key**.
5. Enter a nickname for the key, then paste the key into the public key field.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Go back to your extension and try connecting again.
</Steps>

## Extension states

When the **Continuous payment** toggle is on, the extension icon appears in color. When the toggle is off, the icon appears in gray. Whether a page is web monetized does not affect the color of the icon.

#### Continuous payment toggled on

| Icon | State |
| :----: | ----- |
| <div style="padding-left: 5px;">![Continuous payments turned on in extension, extension is paying](/img/docs/extension/enabled-monetized.png "Active icon state with green circle and checkmark")</div> | Page is web monetized and the extension is continuously paying |
| <div style="padding-left: 5px;">![Continuous payments turned on in extension, extension is not paying and needs user attention](/img/docs/extension/enabled-attention.png "Active icon state with orange circle and exclamation mark")</div> | Page is web monetized, but the extension needs user attention and is **not** continuously paying |
| <div style="padding-left: 5px;">![Continuous payments turned on in extension, page is not web monetized](/img/docs/extension/enabled-unmonetized.png "Active icon state with red circle and x")</div> | Page is **not** web monetized, the extension is **not** continuously paying |

#### Continuous payment toggled off

| Icon | State |
| :----: | ----- |
| <div style="padding-left: 5px;">![Continuous payments turned off in extension](/img/docs/extension/disabled-monetized.png "Inactive icon state with green circle and checkmark")</div> | Page is web monetized, but the extension is **not** continuously paying |
| <div style="padding-left: 5px;">![Continuous payments turned off in extension, needs user attention](/img/docs/extension/disabled-attention.png "Inactive icon state with orange circle and exclamation mark")</div> | Page is web monetized, but the extension needs user attention and is **not** continuously paying |
| <div style="padding-left: 5px;">![Continuous payments turned off in extension, page is not web monetized](/img/docs/extension/disabled-unmonetized.png "Inactive icon state with red circle and x")</div> | Page is **not** web monetized, so the extension is **not** continuously paying |

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>I get an error from my wallet provider when linking the extension to my wallet. Why?</summary>
It's hard to say without a specific error message. Two likely scenarios are:
* You waited too long to accept the connection. Your wallet provider might only give you a short window to accept the connection to keep your account safe. 
* You accepted the connection too quickly--within seconds. Your wallet provider may do this as a security measure against bots or to ensure you've read the contents of the screen. Interledger Wallet, for example, enforces a minimum five second wait.

Click **Connect** and try linking your extension again.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I know the page I'm visiting is web monetized, but the extension says its not. Why?</summary>
The most likely reason is that your wallet provider and the content owner or publisher's wallet provider are not yet able to transact with one another. Your extension will display an exclamation mark within an orange circle. Open the extension to read the messaging.

Visit the [Web Monetization-enabled wallets](/docs/resources/op-wallets) page for a list of compatible wallet providers.
