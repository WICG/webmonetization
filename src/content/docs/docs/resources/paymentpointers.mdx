Payment pointers are a required component of Web Monetization.

A payment pointer is a unique URL that provides an entry point into the <LinkOut href="https://docs.openpayments.guide/">Open Payments APIs</LinkOut>. Every Open Payments-enabled account has a payment pointer.

To [enable Web Monetization](/docs/guides/monetize-page), add your payment pointer as the `href` value in your monetization `<link>` element.
