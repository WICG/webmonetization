An Open Payments-enabled wallet is a required component of Web Monetization. Your OP-enabled wallet provides you with a wallet address, which is an entry point into the <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.guide/">Open Payments APIs</LinkOut>.

To [enable Web Monetization](/docs/guides/monetize-page), add your wallet address as the `href` value in your monetization `<link>` element.
