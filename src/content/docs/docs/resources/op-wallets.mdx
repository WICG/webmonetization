A Web Monetization-enabled wallet is required to send and/or receive payments. The wallet providers on this page are set up to support Web Monetization.

Be sure to select a provider that is available in your **region** and supports your preferred **currency**.

Your provider will assign you a wallet address. You'll need this address when setting up the [extension](/docs/intro/web-monetization-extension) and/or web monetizing your [content](/docs/guides/monetize-page).
