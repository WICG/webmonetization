A Web Monetization-enabled wallet is required to send and/or receive payments. The wallet providers on this page are set up to support Web Monetization.

Be sure to select a provider that is available in your **region** and supports your preferred **currency**.

Your provider will assign you a payment address, called either a wallet address or a payment pointer.
