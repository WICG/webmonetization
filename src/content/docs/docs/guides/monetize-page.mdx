This page provides basic instructions for adding Web Monetization to a web page. If you're new to web monetizing content, this guide is a great place to start.

## Prerequisites

- Web monetized pages must be secure and served over HTTPS.
- You must have the wallet address assigned to you by your Web Monetization-enabled [wallet provider](/docs/resources/op-wallets).

## Monetize a page

To add Web Monetization to a page, add the monetization `<link>` element to the page's `<head>`.

The elementâ€™s `rel` value is always `monetization`. The `href` value is your wallet address. If your wallet address is a payment pointer, it must be entered in <LinkOut href='https://paymentpointers.org/'>URL format</LinkOut>.

For example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Site</title>
    <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example/alice" />
  </head>
</html>
```

### Multiple monetization links

A single HTML document can contain multiple monetization `<link>` elements; however, it's up to each Web Monetization provider to decide how they want to handle this scenario. We recommend Web Monetization providers split the payments evenly between the links.

## Next steps

Now that you've web monetized your page, you can choose to [remove ads](/docs/guides/remove-ads), [provide exclusive content](/docs/guides/provide-exclusive-content), or respond to [`monetization` events](/docs/references/monetizationevent) in some other way when a web monetized visitor accesses your page.
