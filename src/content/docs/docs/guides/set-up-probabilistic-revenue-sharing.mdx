title: Set up probabilistic revenue sharing

How do you share a portion of a web monetized page's earnings when a monetization `<link>` element only supports one wallet address as its `href` value?

One way is through probabilistic revenue sharing. Probabilistic revenue sharing works by choosing from a list of predefined wallet addresses each time a web monetized visitor loads the page. Payments are sent to the chosen wallet address until the visitor reloads or closes the page.

The chance of a wallet address being chosen is based on its assigned weight. For example, if Alice's wallet address has a weight of 50 (out of 100), then her wallet address has a 50% chance of being chosen. The laws of probability state that Alice's share of the page's total revenue will approach 50% as more web monetized visitors access the page.

## Example

This example shows how to use probabilistic revenue sharing by including a script on your web monetized page. It also uses payment pointers, but you can use any Open Payments-enabled wallet addresses.

:::note
If you don't want to include a script on your page, you can use our [Probabilistic Revshare Generator](/prob-revshare). After entering your payment pointers and/or other Open Payments-enabled wallet addresses, along with weights, the generator will provide you with a monetization `<link>` element that contains a unique `href` URL hosted on `https://webmonetization.org/prob-revshare/`.
:::

The example below shows a list of weighted [payment pointers](/docs/resources/glossary#payment-pointer). The easiest way to establish weight is to assign values that add up to 100.

```html
<head>
  <script>
    // Define your revenue share here.
    // If the weights add up to 100 then they represent the percent each payment pointer gets.
    const pointers = {
      '$wallet.example.com/alice': 50,
      '$wallet.example.com/bob': 40,
      '$wallet.example.com/connie': 9.5,
      '$wallet.example.com/dave': 0.5,
    }

    function pickPointer() {
      const sum = Object.values(pointers).reduce(
        (sum, weight) => sum + weight,
        0,
      )
      let choice = Math.random() * sum

      for (const pointer in pointers) {
        const weight = pointers[pointer]
        if ((choice -= weight) <= 0) {
          return pointer
        }
      }
    }

    window.addEventListener('load', () => {
      const monetizationTag = document.createElement('link')
      monetizationTag.rel = 'monetization'
      monetizationTag.href = pickPointer()

      document.head.appendChild(monetizationTag)
    })
  </script>
</head>
```

### How it works

First, we list the payment pointers and assign each one a weight.

If the combined weights equal 100, then each weight represents the percentage at which each payment pointer will be chosen. For example, `$wallet.example.com/connie` has a 9.5% chance of being chosen, resulting in Connie's share approaching 9.5% of the page's total revenue as more web monetized visitors access the site.

```js
const pointers = {
  '$wallet.example.com/alice': 50,
  '$wallet.example.com/bob': 40,
  '$wallet.example.com/connie': 9.5,
  '$wallet.example.com/dave': 0.5,
}
```

:::info
Since this method bypasses the need to include a monetization `<link>` element, you can choose to use a payment pointer's shorthand form (e.g., `$wallet.example.com/alice`) rather than the endpoint URL that the payment pointer resolves to (e.g. `https://wallet.example.com/alice`).
:::

Next, we define the function to cause payment pointers to be chosen based on weight.

```jsx
function pickPointer() {
  const sum = Object.values(pointers).reduce((sum, weight) => sum + weight, 0)
  let choice = Math.random() * sum

  for (const pointer in pointers) {
    const weight = pointers[pointer]
    if ((choice -= weight) <= 0) {
      return pointer
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, we add the code that dynamically inserts the randomly chosen payment pointer into the page on each load/refresh.

```jsx
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  const monetizationTag = document.createElement('link')
  monetizationTag.rel = 'monetization'
  monetizationTag.href = pickPointer()

  document.head.appendChild(monetizationTag)
})
```

### Interactive example

This example shows how the random choices will approach the correct percentages over enough tries. You can customize the number of times to randomly choose a pointer and it will show you the results.
