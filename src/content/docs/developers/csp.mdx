A <LinkOut href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy">Content Security Policy (CSP)</LinkOut> is an extra layer of security that allows you to control the resources a user agent, such as a web browser, is allowed to load for a given page. CSPs use directives to describe the policies for a certain resource type.

The `monetization-src` fetch directive allows you to define the payment pointer and wallet address URLs that a browser can load. If an attempt is made to load an undefined URL, a network error will occur and the URL will not load.

## Syntax

```http
Content-Security-Policy: monetization-src <value>;
Content-Security-Policy: monetization-src <value>, <value>;
```

Where `<value>` is a payment pointer or wallet address URL that's allowed to load.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: monetization-src https://example.com;
```

## Example

Your wallet address is `https://wallet.example.com/alice`. You want to ensure that no other URLs can be loaded.

You configure your web server to return the following `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header on each applicable page of your website.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: monetization-src https://wallet.example.com/alice;
```

A bad actor injects their wallet address into your site.

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://example.org/damien" />
```

However, fetches for the injected URL will return a network error and not load because the URL doesn't match what you've defined in your CSP.
