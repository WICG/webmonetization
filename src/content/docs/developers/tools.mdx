import { LinkButton } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { LinkOut } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

The <LinkOut href="https://webmonetization.org/tools">Publisher Tools</LinkOut> page provides a collection of easy-to-customize components that you can use to tell your visitors about Web Monetization.

## Banner

Create a banner that appears when your visitors don't have the Web Monetization extension or have the extension turned off. The banner automatically includes a link for your visitor to download the extension from their browser's store. Customize the settings, then generate a script to place on your site. 

```js wrap title="Example"
<script id="wmt-init-script" 
    type="module" 
    src="https://webmonetization.org/tools/init.js?wa=example.com/alice&types=banner">
</script>
```

The script automatically web monetizes your site. If your page contains [multiple](/developers/link-element#multiple-monetization-links) monetization links, payments from the extension are only split between unique payment pointers/wallet addresses. 

Generating your script saves your configuration. To change your banner, click **Import** and enter your wallet address. Your existing banner configuration will load.
