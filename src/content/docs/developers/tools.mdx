Use any of the following tools to tell your visitors about Web Monetization.

## Banner

https://webmonetization.org/create/banner

Customize a banner and generate a script to place the banner on your site. It appears when your visitors don't have the Web Monetization extension or have the extension turned off. The banner includes a link for your visitor to download the extension from their browser's store.

The script automatically web monetizes your site. If your page contains [multiple](/developers/link-element#multiple-monetization-links) monetization links, payments from the extension are only split between unique addresses. 

```js wrap title="Example"
<script id="wmt-init-script" 
    type="module" 
    src="https://webmonetization.org/tools/init.js?wa=example.com/alice&types=banner">
</script>
```

When you generate your script, your customizations are saved automatically. To change your banner, click **Import** and enter your wallet address. Your existing banner configuration will load.
