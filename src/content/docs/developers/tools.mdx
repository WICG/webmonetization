The <LinkOut href="https://webmonetization.org/tools">publisher tools</LinkOut> page provides a collection of easy-to-customize components that you can use to promote Web Monetization and encourage your visitors to support you.

## Banner

Create a banner that appears when your visitors don't have the Web Monetization extension or have the extension turned off. The banner automatically includes a link for your visitor to download the extension from their browser's store. Customize the settings, then generate a script to place on your site. The script will automatically web monetize your site.

```js wrap title="Example"
<script
  id='wmt-init-script'
  type='module'
  src='https://webmonetization.org/tools/init.js?wa=example.com/alice&types=banner'
></script>
```

Generating the script saves your configuration to our server. Load your existing banner configuration by clicking **Import** and entering your wallet address. Any changes you make are saved and will appear on your site.

## Link tag generator

Use our link tag generator to create your Web Monetization link tag. Enter your wallet address into the provided field and click **Generate**. Then, copy the tag and add it to your HTML pages.

The generator will check for syntax, but not whether you've entered your information correctly.

## Probabilistic revshare generator

Probabilistic revenue sharing (revshare) is a way to share a portion of a web monetized page's earnings between multiple recipients. Each time the page loads, a recipient is chosen at random from a list of predefined wallet addresses. The probability of one recipient being chosen over the others is based on a weight you assign to each recipient.

The revshare generator allows you to enter each recipient's wallet address and assign it a weight. The percentage of a page's total revenue a recipient should receive, over time, calculates automatically. When you're finished, copy the link tag to your HTML page.

:::note
We host your link tag on webmonetization.org. If you'd rather host your own script, check out the [revshare tutorial](/tutorials/revenue-sharing).
