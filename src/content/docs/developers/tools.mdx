The <LinkOut href="https://webmonetization.org/tools">publisher tools</LinkOut> page provides a collection of easy-to-customize components that you can use to promote Web Monetization and encourage your visitors to support you.

## Banner

Create a banner that appears when your visitors don't have the Web Monetization extension or have the extension turned off. The banner automatically includes a link for your visitor to download the extension from their browser's store. 

Customize the settings, then generate a script to place on your site. The script will automatically web monetize your site. 

```js wrap title="Example"
<script id="wmt-init-script" 
    type="module" 
    src="https://cdn.webmonetization.org/tools/init.js?wa=example.com/alice&types=banner">
</script>
```

Generating the script saves your configuration to our server. Load your existing banner configuration by clicking **Import** and entering your wallet address. Any changes you make are saved and will appear on your site.

## Widget 

Create a widget that lets your visitors send you a one-time payment. The widget appears to all visitors, even those with an active Web Monetization extension. 

Customize the settings, then generate a script. Place the script just before the closing tag on your site or within a script-type element if you're using a site management tool like WordPress.

```js wrap title="Example"
<script id="wmt-init-script" 
    type="module" 
    src="https://cdn.webmonetization.org/tools/init.js?wa=example.com/alice&types=widget">
</script>
```

:::note
If you're using multiple wallet addresses to monetize your site, payments through the widget are only delivered to the address entered during configuration.

Generating the script saves your configuration to our server. Load an existing widget configuration by clicking **Import** and entering your wallet address. Any changes you make are saved and will appear on your site.

## Probabilistic revshare generator

Probabilistic revenue sharing (revshare) is a way to share a portion of a web monetized page's earnings between multiple recipients. Each time the page loads, a recipient is chosen at random from a list of predefined wallet addresses. 

Enter each recipient's wallet address and assign it a weight. The probability of one recipient being chosen over the others is based on their assigned weight. The percentage field calculates automatically and reflects the total revenue a recipient should receive over time.

When you're finished, copy the link tag to your HTML page.

:::note
We host your link tag on webmonetization.org. If you'd rather host your own script, check out the [revshare tutorial](/tutorials/revenue-sharing).
