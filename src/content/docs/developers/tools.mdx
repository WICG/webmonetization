The <LinkOut href="https://webmonetization.org/tools">publisher tools</LinkOut> page provides a collection of easy-to-customize components that you can use to promote Web Monetization and encourage your visitors to support you.

## Banner

Create a banner that appears when your visitors don't have the Web Monetization extension or have the extension turned off. The banner automatically includes a link for your visitor to download the extension from their browser's store. Customize the settings, then generate a script to place on your site. 

```js wrap title="Example"
<script id="wmt-init-script" 
    type="module" 
    src="https://webmonetization.org/tools/init.js?wa=example.com/alice&types=banner">
</script>
```

The script automatically web monetizes your site. If your page contains [multiple](/developers/link-element#multiple-monetization-links) monetization links, payments from the extension are only split between unique payment pointers/wallet addresses. 

Generating your script saves your configuration. To change your banner, click **Import** and enter your wallet address. Your existing banner configuration will load.

## Link tag generator

Use our link tag generator to create your Web Monetization link tag. Enter your payment pointer or wallet address into the provided field and click **Generate**. Then, copy the tag and add it to your HTML pages.

The generator will check that your payment pointer or wallet address follows the correct syntax, but not whether you've entered your information correctly. Be sure to check for typos!

## Probabilistic revshare generator

Probabilistic revenue sharing (revshare) is a way to share a portion of a web monetized page's earnings between multiple recipients. Each time the page is loaded, a recipient is chosen at random from a list of predefined payment pointers and wallet addresses. The probability of one recipient being chosen over the others is based on a weight you assign to each recipient. 

The revshare generator allows you to enter each recipient's payment pointer or wallet address and assign it a weight. The percentage of a page's total revenue a recipient should receive, over time, calculates automatically. When you're finished, copy the link tag to your HTML page.

:::note
The link tag is hosted on webmonetization.org. If you'd rather host your own script, check out the [revshare tutorial](/tutorials/revenue-sharing).
