## Prerequisites

<Wallet />

## Step 1 - Get your payment URL

### Payment pointer

If you have a payment pointer that starts with `$`, visit <LinkOut href='https://paymentpointers.org/'>paymentpointers.org</LinkOut>. Enter your payment pointer into the _Payment Pointer_ field. Take note of the URL that automatically generates in the adjacent field. This is your payment URL. You'll need it in the next step.

```http title="Example"
$wallet.example.com/alice
```

### Wallet address

If you have a wallet address that starts with `https://`, then you have your payment URL. Proceed to the next step.

```http title="Example"
https://wallet.example.com/alice
```

## Step 2 - Web monetize your page

<Steps>

1. Create your Web Monetization link tag using the format below. Add your payment URL as the `href` value.

   ```http
   <link rel="monetization" href="your_url">
   ```

   For example:

   ```http
   <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
   ```

2. Add the `<link>` to the `<head>` section of your page.
   ```html title="Example" wrap
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Site</title>
        <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
      </head>
    </html>
    ```
</Steps>

Congratulations! Your page is now web monetized. Add the `<link>` to any page of your site you want to monetize.
