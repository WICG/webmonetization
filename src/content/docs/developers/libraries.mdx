The most recent draft of the <LinkOut href="https://webmonetization.org/specification/">Web Monetization specification (v2.0)</LinkOut> introduced updates to be more consistent with the design of other browser features. As a result, libraries that implemented v1.0 of the specification need code updates to be compatible with v2.0.

We encourage the community to support the Web Monetization ecosystem by updating existing tools/libraries to be compatible with the latest spec and by creating new tools and plugins for frameworks and libraries.

For more information, check out Santosh's <LinkOut href="https://community.interledger.org/devcer/developer-guide-to-migrating-the-breaking-changes-in-the-latest-web-monetization-draft-cj2">developer guide</LinkOut> to migrating the breaking changes in the latest Web Monetization draft.
