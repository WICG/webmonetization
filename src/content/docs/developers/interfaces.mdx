The Web Monetization API consists of two interfaces: `MonetizationEvent` and `MonetizationCurrencyAmount`.

## MonetizationEvent

The `MonetizationEvent` interface describes the [`monetization`](/developers/events) event that fires when an outgoing payment is successfully created.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Bubbles</th>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cancelable</th>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Event handler property</th>
    <td>`onmonetization`</td>
  </tr>
</table>

By listening for `monetization` events, you can use the information returned in the following properties to verify payments.

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| [amountSent](/developers/events#amountsent) | The currency amount and code of the sent payment. Contains two variables, `value` and `currency`, constructed by the [`MonetizationCurrencyAmount`](#monetizationcurrencyamount) interface. |
| [incomingPayment](/developers/events#incomingpayment) | A URL you can use to determine if a payment was received and, if so, the amount received. |
| [paymentPointer](/developers/events#paymentpointer) | The URL of the wallet address or payment pointer that the incoming payment request was sent to. |

Visit the [Monetization events](/developers/events) page for more information.

<Specification anchor='monetizationevent-interface' />

## MonetizationCurrencyAmount

The `MonetizationCurrencyAmount` interface is used to populate the `value` and `currency` variables contained within the `MonetizationEvent amountSent` property.

- Value - The amount. A valid decimal monetary value containing the amount that was sent.
- Currency - The currency code. An ISO 4217-compliant currency code, when possible, that represents the currency that was sent. For example, USD (for US dollar) or GBP (for Great Britain Pound).

The `MonetizationCurrencyAmount` interface is modeled on the Payment Request APIâ€™s <LinkOut href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentcurrencyamount-dictionary">`PaymentCurrencyAmount`</LinkOut> dictionary.
