To change the rate of pay:

<Steps>
  1. Click the **Settings** icon in the upper-right of the extension.

2.  Select the _Rate_ tab, then enter the amount to send, per hour, to web monetized sites. Your changes are automatically saved.

    />

</Steps>

## Send continuous payments

Visit <LinkOut href="https://sidvishnoi.com/test/wm/" withIcon={false}>https://sidvishnoi.com/test/wm/</LinkOut>.

This page's test wallet receives all payments in Mexican pesos (MX$) regardless of the currency you chose to use for your own test wallet.

Each payment appears within the _Monetization events_ section on the test site.<br /><img src='/img/docs/testwallet/testwallet-sid-continuous-events.png' alt='Monetization events section showing two payments of MXN 0.21' style='max-width:250px' class='img-outline'/>

If your extension is using <abbr title="US dollars">USD</abbr> with the default rate of $0.60 an hour, a new event appears on the site about every two minutes as long as the window is active. Continuous payments stop when the window is inactive. Keep the window active until a few payment events appear. Then, sign in to your <LinkOut href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/">wallet account</LinkOut> and select **Transactions** to see the payments you've sent.

2. Check that the extension shows a green circle. If not, try refreshing the page.
