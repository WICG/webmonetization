## Configure continuous payments (optional)

To change the rate of pay:
<Steps>
    1. Click the **Settings** icon in the upper-right of the extension.
    2. Select the *Rate* tab, then enter the amount to send, per hour, to web monetized sites. Your changes are automatically saved.<br /><img src='/img/docs/extension/rate-tab.png' alt='Rate tab with rate of pay per hour field and continuous payment toggle' style='max-width:300px' class='img-outline'/>
</Steps>

## Send continuous payments

Visit <LinkOut href="https://sidvishnoi.com/test/wm/" withIcon={false}>https://sidvishnoi.com/test/wm/</LinkOut>. 

This page's test wallet receives all payments in Mexican pesos (MX$) regardless of the currency you chose to use for your own test wallet. 

Check the status of the extension.

| Icon | Status |
| ---- | ------ |
| ![Active extension with green circle](/img/docs/extension/enabled-monetized.png) | The extension is sending continuous payments. |
| ![Active extension with red circle](/img/docs/extension/enabled-unmonetized.png) | The extension is not sending continuous payments. Refresh the page. |

Each payment appears within the *Monetization events* section on the test site.<br /><img src='/img/docs/testwallet/testwallet-sid-continuous-events.png' alt='Monetization events section showing two payments of MXN 0.21' style='max-width:250px' class='img-outline'/>

If your extension is using <abbr title="US dollars">USD</abbr> with the default rate of $0.60 an hour, a new event appears on the site about every two minutes as long as the window is active. Continuous (streaming) Web Monetization payments stop when the window is inactive. Keep the window active until a few payment events appear. Then, sign in to your <LinkOut href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/">wallet account</LinkOut> and select **Transactions** to see the payments you've sent.

## Send a one-time payment
