Sign up for a <LinkOut href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev">test wallet</LinkOut> with the Interledger Foundation to experiment with sending and receiving Web Monetization payments without using real money.
  
## Step 1 - Create an account
  
<Steps>
  1. Go to <LinkOut href='https://wallet.interledger-test.dev'>wallet.interledger-test.dev</LinkOut> and click **Create account**.
  2. Enter your email address and a password, then click the arrowhead. A verification email will be sent to you.
  3. Click **Confirm my email address** within the verification email.
  4. Log in to your newly created account and complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) steps.
</Steps>

## Step 2 - Complete KYC
     
As you go through the Know Your Customer (KYC) check, the only real information you must share is your email address. All other information can be fake because you're signing up for a test environment.

:::note[Reason for checks]
The Interledger test wallet runs on a GateHub pre-production environment. This environment mimics their production environment, including many of their <LinkOut href="https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021131234-KYC-requirements-for-account-verification">KYC steps</LinkOut>.

:::note[Deposit amounts]
Although you're depositing fake money, large deposits are manually reviewed and approved by the test network team. This can take up to 24 hours. If you want to test immediately, we recommend keeping your deposits between 50 and 1,000. Also note that depositing more than 10,000 in a 24 hour period will cause your deposits to go into the manual review process.
