Sign up for a <LinkOut href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev">test wallet</LinkOut> with Interledger Foundation to experiment with sending and receiving Web Monetization payments without using real money.

## Step 1 - Create an account

1. Go to <LinkOut href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev">wallet.interledger-test.dev</LinkOut> and click **Create account**.
2. Enter your email address and a password, then click the arrowhead. A verification email will be sent to you.
3. Click **Confirm my email address** in the verification email.
4. Log in to your newly created account and complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) steps.

## Step 2 - Complete KYC

As you go through the Know Your Customer (KYC) check, the only real information you must share is your email address. All other information can be fake because you're signing up for a test environment.

:::note[Reason for checks]
Interledger Foundation's test wallet runs on a GateHub pre-production environment. This environment mimics their production environment, including many of their <LinkOut href="https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021131234-KYC-requirements-for-account-verification">KYC steps</LinkOut>.
