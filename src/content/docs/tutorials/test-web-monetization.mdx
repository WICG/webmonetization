    ### Complete KYC and liveness checks
      As you go through KYC, the only real information you need to share is your email address and phone number. We ask for your phone number in case we need to send you a verification code.
      
      All other information, including identity documentation, can be fake. If you're asked to upload a photo, it can be of anything as long as it's not blank. A face scan may also be required but is not used by the test wallet in any way.
:::note[Why so many steps?]
The Interledger test wallet runs on a GateHub pre-production environment. This environment mimics their production environment, including the <LinkOut href="https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021131234-KYC-requirements-for-account-verification">KYC steps</LinkOut>.

      <Steps>
        1. Click **Deposit**.<br /><img src='/img/docs/testwallet/testwallet-nobalance-pp.png' alt='Account showing no balance and newly created payment pointer' style='max-width:350px' class='img-outline'/>

      </Steps>
:::note
Even though you aren't using real money, large deposits will be manually reviewed and approved. This can take up to 24 hours. If you're wanting to test immediately, make smaller deposits.
Similarly, depositing more than 10,000 in a 24 hour period will cause your deposits to go into the manual review process.

You're ready to start testing Web Monetization after your deposit appears in your account.<br /><img src='/img/docs/testwallet/testwallet-balance-pp.png' alt='Account showing balance amount and payment pointer' style='max-width:350px' class='img-outline'/>

      ### Configure continuous payments (optional)

      By default, the extension is set to send continuous payments at a rate of $0.60 USD an hour ($0.01 a minute), or whatever the equivalent is in your chosen currency based on the exchange rate.

      To change the rate of pay:
      <Steps>
        1. Click the **Settings** icon in the upper-right of the extension.
        2. Select the *Rate* tab, then enter the amount to send, per hour, to web monetized sites. Your changes are automatically saved.<br /><img src='/img/docs/extension/rate-tab.png' alt='Rate tab with rate of pay per hour field and continuous payment toggle' style='max-width:300px' class='img-outline'/>
      </Steps>
    </Card>
    <Card>
      ### Send continuous payments

      Visit <LinkOut href="https://sidvishnoi.com/test/wm/" withIcon={false}>https://sidvishnoi.com/test/wm/</LinkOut>. 

      The currency of this page's test wallet address is denominated in Mexican pesos (MXN). Regardless of the currency used by your test wallet, the recipient will receive payments in MXN.

      Check the status of the extension.

      | Icon | Status |
      | ---- | ------ |
      | ![Active extension with green circle](/img/docs/extension/enabled-monetized.png) | The extension is paying. |
      | ![Active extension with red circle](/img/docs/extension/enabled-unmonetized.png) | The extension is not paying. Refresh the page. |

      Payments appear on the test site, within the *Monetization events* section.<br /><img src='/img/docs/testwallet/testwallet-sid-continuous-events.png' alt='Monetization events section showing two payments of MXN 0.21' style='max-width:250px' class='img-outline'/>

      If your extension is using USD with the default rate of $0.60 an hour, you'll see a new event on the test site about every two minutes.
