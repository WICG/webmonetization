  <TabItem label="Sign up for a test wallet account">
  The test wallet allows you to go through a mock Know Your Customer (KYC) sign up flow, create a payment account, add a payment pointer, and fund the account.

  * [Create an account](#create-an-account)
    * [Complete KYC and liveness checks](#complete-kyc-and-liveness-checks)
  * [Set up your account for Web Monetization](#set-up-your-account-for-web-monetization)
    * [Add a payment pointer](#add-a-payment-pointer)
    * [Make a deposit](#make-a-deposit)

  ### Create an account

  <Steps>
    1. Go to <LinkOut href='https://wallet.interledger-test.dev'>wallet.interledger-test.dev</LinkOut>
    and click **Create account**.
    2. Enter your email address and a password, then click the arrowhead. A verification email will be sent to you.
    3. Click **Confirm my email address** within the verification email.
    4. Log in to your newly created account and complete the KYC and liveness checks.
  </Steps>

  ### Complete KYC and liveness checks

  As you go through KYC, the only real information you need to share is your email address and phone number. We ask for your phone number in case we need to send you a verification code.

  All other information, including identity documentation, can be fake. If you're asked to upload a photo, it can be of anything as long as it's not blank. A face scan may also be required but is not used by the test wallet in any way.

  :::note[Why are there so many steps?]
  The Interledger test wallet runs on a GateHub pre-production environment. This environment mimics their live production environment, including the <LinkOut href="https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021131234-KYC-requirements-for-account-verification">KYC steps</LinkOut>.

  ### Make a deposit 

  <Steps>
    1. Click **Deposit**.<br /><img src='/img/docs/testwallet/testwallet-nobalance-pp.png' alt='Account showing no balance and newly created payment pointer' style='max-width:350px' class='img-outline'/>

        :::note
        Even though you aren't using real money, large deposits will be manually reviewed and approved. This can take up to 24 hours. If you're wanting to test immediately, make smaller deposits.
        
        Similarly, depositing more than 10,000 in a 24 hour period will cause your deposits to go into the manual review process.
        :::

        You're ready to start testing Web Monetization after your deposit appears in your account.<br /><img src='/img/docs/testwallet/testwallet-balance-pp.png' alt='Account showing balance amount and payment pointer' style='max-width:350px' class='img-outline'/>
