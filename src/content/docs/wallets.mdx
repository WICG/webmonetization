You must have an account with a compatible wallet provider to send or receive Web Monetization payments. It can take up to 24 hours for a wallet provider to confirm your identity when setting up a new account.

Be sure to select a wallet that's available in your **region** and supports your preferred **currency**. See the [Limitations](#limitations) section for additional details.

<sup>* Select *Hosted* wallet during setup</sup>

Some wallet providers will allow you to select your own wallet address. A wallet address will look like this: `https://interledger.app/<your_username>`.

### Supported currencies

When choosing a wallet provider for Web Monetization, be sure to select one that supports your preferred currency. Wallet providers may support different currencies, including cryptocurrencies.

### Wallet addresses and payment pointers

Some wallet providers will use the term *wallet address* while others use the term *payment pointer*. Wallet addresses contain `https://` while payment pointers contain `$`.

## Interledger test wallet

The Interledger test wallet provides a great way to test Web Monetization without using real money. The test wallet is an open-source application developed and maintained by the [Interledger Foundation](https://interledger.org).

[Create an account on the Interledger test network](/guides/test-wallet-sign-up) to test Web Monetization without real money.

## Where is my wallet address/payment pointer?

<details>

    Users of the Interledger Wallet will have a _wallet address_. It appears on the _Home_ screen after signing in. Although `https://` isn't shown in the field, it is added to your address when you click the copy button.

        :::note
        If you're setting up the extension, you can enter your payment pointer as it's shown. If you're adding Web Monetization to your website, you must change `$` to `https://`. For example, `https://ilp.gatehub.net/150012576/USD`.
