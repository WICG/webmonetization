You must have an account with a compatible wallet provider to send or receive Web Monetization payments. It can take up to 24 hours for a wallet provider to confirm your identity when setting up a new account.

Be sure to select a wallet that's available in your **region** and supports your preferred **currency**. See the [Limitations](#limitations) section for additional details.

Some wallet providers will allow you to select your own wallet address. A wallet address will look like this: `https://interledger.app/<your_username>`.

### Supported currencies

When choosing a wallet provider for Web Monetization, be sure to select one that supports your preferred currency. Wallet providers may support different currencies, including cryptocurrencies.

### Wallet addresses and payment pointers

Some wallet providers will use the term *wallet address* while others use the term *payment pointer*. Wallet addresses contain `https://` while payment pointers contain `$`.

[Create an account on the Interledger test network](/guides/test-wallet-sign-up) to test Web Monetization without real money.

## Where is my wallet address/payment pointer?
