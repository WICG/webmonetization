You must have an account with a compatible wallet provider to send or receive Web Monetization payments. It can take up to 24 hours for a wallet provider to confirm your identity when setting up a new account.

Be sure to select a wallet that's available in your **region** and supports your preferred **currency**. See the [Limitations](#limitations) section for additional details.

## Wallet providers

| Provider  | Available in | Supported currencies |
| -------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| <LinkOut href="https://interledger.app/">Interledger Wallet</LinkOut> | USA, Canada, EU, South Africa | $ USD, $ CAD, € EUR, R ZAR |
| <LinkOut href="https://gatehub.net">GateHub*</LinkOut> | USA, EU | $ USD, € EUR |

<sup>* Select *Hosted* wallet during setup</sup>

Some wallet providers will allow you to select your own wallet address. A wallet address is similar to an email address. For example, `https://interledger.app/<your_username>`.

### Supported currencies

Web Monetization compatibility is one feature of many that a wallet provider could offer. For example, a wallet provider can choose to support foreign reserve and local currencies in Web Monetization payments while supporting cryptocurrency transactions as a separate product offering, independent of Web Monetization.

When choosing a wallet provider for Web Monetization, be sure to select one that supports your preferred currency.

### Wallet addresses and payment pointers

Some wallet providers will use the term *wallet address* while others use the term *payment pointer*. Wallet addresses contain `https://` while payment pointers contain `$`. For example, `$ilp.gatehub.net/12345/usd`. Both formats work when [setting up the extension](/supporters/get-started). If you're web monetizing your own content, change the `$` to `https://` in the [monetization link tag](/developers/get-started). 

## Limitations

### Interledger Wallet

Users of the Interledger Wallet can only send and receive from other Interledger Wallet users who are in the same region and using the same currency.

### GateHub 

Users of the GateHub wallet can only send and receive from other GateHub wallet users.

## Interledger test wallet

The Interledger test wallet provides a great way to test Web Monetization without using real money. The test wallet is an open-source application developed and maintained by the [Interledger Foundation](https://interledger.org).

[Create an account on the Interledger test network](/guides/test-wallet-sign-up) to test Web Monetization without real money.

## Where is my wallet address/payment pointer?

<details>

    Users of the Interledger Wallet will have a _wallet address_. It appears on the _Home_ screen after signing in. Although `https://` isn't shown in the field, it is added to your address when you click the copy button.

        :::note
