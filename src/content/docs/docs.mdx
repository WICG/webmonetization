Web Monetization is a technology that enables websites to receive payments from visitors as they interact with the content.

Website owners, content owners, and publishers can use Web Monetization to replace or complement existing revenue models.

Site visitors can make a one-time contribution or send continuous payments as they spend time on web monetized content. The amount and frequency of payments is chosen by the visitor, not the website.
