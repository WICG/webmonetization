From a creator/developer perspective, the monetization `<link>` element is one of the two key pieces to adding web monetization to a page. The second piece is your wallet address/payment pointer.

## Prerequisites

To web monetize an HTML document, such as a web page:
* You must have an account with a [compatible wallet](/resources/wallets)
* You must have the wallet address, or payment pointer in <LinkOut href="https://paymentpointers.org">URL format</LinkOut>, from your wallet provider
* Your document must be secure and served over HTTPS

## Monetization `<link>` element

The monetization `<link>` element is what indicates your HTML page supports Web Monetization.

### Syntax

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://(paymentUrl)">
```

* The `rel` attribute is always `monetization`
* The `href` attribute equals your wallet address or your payment pointer in URL format

For example:

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
```

### Placement

A monetization `<link>` is `body-ok`, meaning it's allowed in your page's `<head>` and/or `<body>`.

### Multiple monetization links

An HTML page can contain multiple monetization `<link>` elements; however, there are a few factors that determine if and how a multiple link scenario is monetized. 

First, most browsers enforce a maximum limit of six parallel HTTP connections to the same server. When the maximum is reached, the browser will wait until one of the existing HTTP connections is closed before it initiates the next connection.

Second, your site visitor’s [Web Monetization agent](#web-monetization-agent) could be coded to handle multiple links in a particular way. For example, one visitor’s Web Monetization agent may split payments evenly between all links while another Web Monetization agent only sends payments to the first monetization link it finds.

:::tip[Recommendation]
The Web Monetization agent built into the <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/web-monetization-extension">Interledger Foundation's extension</LinkOut> splits payments evenly between all links. We recommend other extension developers follow this approach.

### Iframes

Nested browsing contexts (iframes) can contain monetization `<link>` elements; however, your site visitor's [Web Monetization agent](#web-monetization-agent) determines how iframes are monetized. A few examples of how a Web Monetization agent can monetize iframes include:

* Splitting payments evenly between all monetization links within both the parent and the iframe
* Splitting payments evenly between all monetization links in the parent and the first monetization link it finds in the iframe's `<head>`, while ignoring any other monetization links in the iframe
    :::note
    This is the approach used in the <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/web-monetization-extension">Interledger Foundation's extension</LinkOut>.

* Sending payments to the first monetization link it finds in the parent browsing context and ignoring all other monetization links in the parent and the iframe

### Audio, video, and picture elements

The following HTML elements can be web monetized by adding the `<link>` element between the open and close tags.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="<audio>" icon="seti:audio">
        ```html
        <audio src="music.mp3">
            <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/bob">
        </audio>
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="<video>" icon="seti:video">
        ```html
        <video src="myvideo">
            <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/bob">
        </video>
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="<picture>" icon="seti:image">
        ```html
        <picture srcset="cat.jpeg">
            <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/bob">
        </picture>
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How it works

### HTML DOM API

Due to the efforts of the <LinkOut href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</LinkOut>, there are a number of APIs that all major browser vendors build into their browsers. One such API is the <LinkOut href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API">HTML DOM API</LinkOut>, which defines the functionality of HTML elements.

#### HTMLLinkElement

The HTML DOM API's `HTMLLinkElement` interface defines how the `<link>` element functions. The `<link>` element is what allows you to link your HTML page to a resource. 

The two most recognizable `HTMLLinkElement` properties are `href` and `rel`. The `href` property defines the URL to the resource. The `rel` property indicates the type of link, or relationship, the resource has to the current page.

### rel="monetization" link type

Browsers already know how to interpret certain `rel` values because of web standards. One such standard is `stylesheet`. When a browser loads a page that contains `<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">`, the browser automatically knows to import a style sheet from the given URL.

The `monetization` link type, however, is not a standard. Major web browsers don't automatically know what to do when encountering this link type in a page. Until `monetization` becomes a standard, browsers must rely on a Web Monetization agent.

### Web Monetization agent

A Web Monetization agent is a non-user facing component of the <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/web-monetization-extension">Interledger Foundation's extension</LinkOut>.

The purpose of the Web Monetization agent is to recognize when a page is web monetized and automatically carry out certain tasks. These tasks include:

* Extending the HTML DOM API so that `monetization` is a valid link type
* Processing the monetization link or links within an HTML page
* Instrumenting payments by calling the [Open Payments APIs](/experiment/how-payments-work#a-deeper-dive-into-payments), which are APIs implemented by wallet providers 
* Firing [`monetization`](/experiment/events) events after an outgoing payment is created
* Processing `monetization` events sent to the browser window via the [`onmonetization`](/experiment/onmonetization) event handler
* Enabling the CSP [`monetization-src`](/experiment/csp) and Permissions Policy [`monetization`](/experiment/permissions-policy) directives

Until Web Monetization agents are natively built in to web browsers, an agent must be added to browsers in some other way. That's why the agent is included as part of the Interledger Foundation's extension.
