## Digital wallets

To receive (and send) payments, you must have an account with a compatible digital wallet. Not all digital wallets support receiving payments with Web Monetization.

A digital wallet is the entity that supplies you with the financial account you’ll use to receive payments. Withdrawing your funds typically requires you to link a card or bank account to your wallet. 

Since wallet providers are a type of financial entity, they are regulated within the countries they operate. One type of regulation, known as KYC (Know Your Customer), requires such entities to collect personal information and verify your identity before allowing you to open an account.

## Web Monetization-compatible digital wallets

You must have an account with a [compatible digital wallet](/resources/wallets) to receive payments. Be sure to select a wallet that:

* Is available in your region
* Supports your preferred currency
* <mark>Allows you to withdraw your funds if you choose to transact in fiat</mark>

Your wallet provider will assign your account a unique ID called either a *payment pointer* or a *wallet address*. This ID is kind of like an account name. It’s a publicly shareable ID that you will need when web monetizing your content.

The format of the ID depends on whether your wallet provider assigned you a payment pointer or a wallet address. 

| ID name | Example format |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Payment pointer | `$wallet.example.com/alice` |
| Wallet address | `https://wallet.example.com/alice` |


## Web monetized content

Once you have your payment pointer or wallet address, you're ready to add the Web Monetization `<link>` element to each page of your site you want to monetize. Visit the [quick start guide](/experiment/quick-start) for more information.

When you include the `<link>` element on a page, you're telling your visitors' browsers that you can accept payments. Visitors who have installed and configured the [Web Monetization extension](/support/use-extension) can then choose to send you payments in the amount and frequency of their choosing.

## Payments

Your visitors' Web Monetization extension acts like a messaging service. When they land on your page, their extension identifies the `<link>` element and parses your payment URL. 

Then, a component within the extension--called the [Web Monetization agent](/experiment/link-element#web-monetization-agent)--issues a `GET` request to your payment URL. In return, it receives the information it needs to begin setting up a payment. The Web Monetization agent passes the information, along with the visitor's payment instructions, to the visitor's wallet provider. The visitor's wallet provider then sends the payment to your wallet provider who credits your account.
