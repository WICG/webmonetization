By creating an `onmonetization` event handler, you can allow your web page to programmatically respond to `monetization` events.

## `window.onmonetization` 

The `onmonetization` event handler is used by the [Web Monetization agent](/docs/resources/glossary#wm-agent) to process `monetization` events sent to the browser `window` (the event target). 

The `onmonetization` property can be applied to any element and is used by the browser to notify that some `<link>` element is [monetized](/docs/implement/link). 

In a tabbed browser, each tab is represented by its own `window` object.

## Syntax

```js 
window.onmonetization=functionRef
```

Where `functionRef` is the event handler function to execute when a `monetization` event fires.

## Example 

Show a message to site visitors to let them know that the page supports Web Monetization. 

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
window.onmonetization = function () {
  alert('This page supports Web Monetization.')
  }
</script>
```
