        Web Monetization allows websites to automatically receive payments from

          This specification is a work in progress within the community on the
          best shape it should take. Please see the <a href=
          "https://webmonetization.org/docs/">explainer</a> for more info.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specification reflects the desired end-state of the Web
          Monetization APIs as currently anticipated and agreed to between the
          contributors. The specification is being prepared here, in this
          format, to collect the input of the Web community and prepare the
          work to ultimately follow the W3C standards track should it have the
          necessary support to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the most accurate reflection of the APIs that have been
          implemented by providers see the <a href=

          Checking if Web Monetization is supported

        <p>
          Call {{DOMTokenList/supports()}} on a [^link^] element’s
          {{HTMLLinkElement/relList}} passing the `"monetization"` keyword to
          check if Web Monetization is supported by the user agent.

        <h3>
          Monetization events
        </h3>
        <p>
          The {{MonetizationEvent}} DOM events provide information such as the
          amount sent, the currency of the payment, and a link to the incoming
          payment at the [=monetization receiver=] which can be used to verify
          the receipt of payment. As in the previous example above, these
          events are dispatched to [^link^] elements and bubble up the DOM
          tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          To listen for {{MonetizationEvent}} events, an [=event listener=]
          needs to be added to the relevant [^link^] element (or to one of its
          ancestors) via JavaScript:
        </p>
        <aside class="example">
          <pre class="html" data-include-format="text" data-include=
          "includes/monetization-event-example.html"></pre>
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Verifying a payment
        </h3>
        <p>
          The {{MonetizationEvent}}'s {{MonetizationEvent/incomingPayment}}
          attribute is a URL that can be used to verify the payment at the
          [=monetization receiver=].
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases requests to the {{MonetizationEvent/incomingPayment}}
          URL will need to be authenticated as they fetch sensitive details
          such as the `receivedAmount`. The specifics of this authentication
          are agreed by the website and the [=monetization receiver=] when
          setting up the receiving account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a hypothetical naive verification method that will make a
          request to the {{MonetizationEvent/incomingPayment}} URL and simply
          return the results. For simplicity it has no logic for authenticating
          the request.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more sophisticated implementation should track the `receivedAmount`
          property and ensure it is increasing after each {{MonetizationEvent}}
          to verify that a new payment has been received.

        Security considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is RECOMMENDED that a user agent provide some UI or indicator that
        allows the user to know when [=monetization=] is possible and/or when
        [=monetization=] is occurring. Providing such a UI allows the users to
        retain control of the monetization process by taking action (e.g., stop
        or start monetization of a particular site if they wish to do so).
      </p>
      <p>
        As [=payment pointers=] are generally provided as a service (e.g.,
        Uphold), a <abbr title="Cross Site Scripting">XSS</abbr> attack could
        inject malicious [=payment pointers=] into a page that uses the same
        service. To mitigate such an attack, it is RECOMMENDED that developers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>host a [=payment pointer=] on their own servers and proxy [[Open
        Payments]] requests on the server as needed.
        </li>
        <li>Set the `monetization-src` CSP directive to restrict requests to
        origins they control and trust to host [=payment pointers=].

      <h2>
        Privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Web Monetization is designed to be privacy-preserving: The user agent
        does not send any data to the [=monetization provider=]. Instead, it
        requests data from the [=monetization provider=] without ever revealing
        the URL of the web page the user is currently browsing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, the user agent gets the payment information from the [=payment
        pointer=] to establish the [=payment session=]. This also ensures the
        [=monetization provider=] doesn't have access to a user's browsing
        history or to the [=payment pointer=].

        Unlike [[[Payment-Request]]] and the [[[Payment-Handler]]], which only
