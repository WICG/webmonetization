  <h2>Monetization status</h2>

  <p>
    User agents SHOULD provide controls to disable Web Monetization completely and on a per-[=origin=]
    basis via a wallet management interface. User agents SHOULD provide a user interface that allows
    users to view and adjust these preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
    A website can disable Web Monetization for itself and/or its subdocuments by setting
    the <a href="https://webmonetization.org/specification/#permissions-policy">`monetization`</a>
    [=policy-controlled feature=].
  </p>

  <p>
    A website can also restrict Web Monetization to <a>wallet addresses</a> of certain [=origin=]s
    by using the <a href="https://webmonetization.org/specification/#content-security-policy">`monetization-src`</a>
    directive in the [=content security policy=].

      given a |document:Document| if either of the following conditions apply:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The user preferences specify that Web Monetization is either completely disabled or disabled specifically

    <h3>Wallet address restrictions</h3>

    <p>
      <dfn data-lt="wallet monetization restricted">Wallet monetization restricted</dfn>
      given a |document:Document| and a [=wallet address=] |walletAddress:DOMString|
      if the <a href="https://webmonetization.org/developers/csp-monetization-src/">`monetization-src`</a> directive
      in the [=content security policy=] of the |document| restricts the |walletAddress|'s [=origin=].
    </p>
  </section>

  <p class="note">
    These mechanisms provide multiple layers of control over Web Monetization: the user controls whether
    monetization is enabled in their browser, the website can control whether monetization is allowed
    via permissions policy, and the website can restrict which wallet addresses are allowed
    via content security policy. All three mechanisms work together to ensure monetization only occurs when all parties consent.
