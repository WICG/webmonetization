  <HowItWorks>
    <p>To receive Web Monetization payments, you’ll need an account with a compatible digital wallet provider. Once you have your wallet address, use the link generator tool to create a Web Monetization <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element and add it to each page you want to monetize. Visitors with the Web Monetization browser extension can then stream payments to you at a rate and frequency they choose.</p>
